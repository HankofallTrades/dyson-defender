Dyson Defender - Game Design Document
Game Concept
Dyson Defender is a 3D space shooter game where the player must defend a Dyson Sphere from waves of alien enemies. The player controls a spaceship equipped with lasers and must destroy enemies before they can damage the Dyson Sphere. The game features a retro-futuristic aesthetic with neon colors, glitch effects, and a dark space background.
