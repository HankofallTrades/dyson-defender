**Structural Recommendations:**

1.  **Centralize Constants:** Your `src/constants/` directory currently only holds `colors.ts`. Consider moving other magic numbers or configuration values scattered throughout the codebase (e.g., entity speeds, damage values, cooldowns, physics parameters, wave definitions, collision layer names) into this directory, perhaps organized into files like `gameplay.ts`, `physics.ts`, `tuning.ts`, etc. This improves maintainability and makes tuning easier.
2.  **Organize Shared Types:** Similar to constants, the `src/types/` directory only contains `meshDefinitions.ts`. If you have other complex type definitions or interfaces shared across different modules (e.g., `AnimationData` union from `components.ts`, specific event types), centralizing them here can improve clarity.
3.  **Review Large Files:** Files like `MeshFactory.ts` (41KB), `CollisionSystem.ts` (27KB), `EnemySystem.ts` (21KB), `AnimationSystem.ts` (21KB), and `HUDSystem.ts` (16KB) are quite large. Evaluate if their responsibilities can be broken down further:
    *   Could `MeshFactory` use helper functions or smaller classes for different categories of meshes?
    *   Could `CollisionSystem` delegate collision *response* logic (like applying damage or triggering effects) to other systems or an event bus, keeping its focus purely on detection?
    *   Could complex AI behaviors in `EnemySystem` be split into smaller state-based systems or helper modules?
4.  **Clarify UI Interaction:** The `HUDSystem` interacts with the React UI. Ensure this boundary is clean. The system should ideally update shared state or emit events that the React UI consumes, rather than directly manipulating UI components, to maintain the separation of concerns outlined in your rules.

**Performance Recommendations:**

1.  **Object Pooling:** Creating and destroying many objects frequently (especially projectiles, enemies, floating scores, animation effects) can strain the garbage collector. Implement object pooling for these common entity types and their associated Three.js meshes (`MeshFactory` is a good place to manage mesh pooling). Instead of destroying, reset and reuse entities/meshes.
2.  **Rendering Optimization (Three.js):**
    *   **Instancing:** If you render many identical objects (e.g., flocks of enemies, asteroid fields, bullets), use `THREE.InstancedMesh` via `MeshFactory` / `RenderingSystem` to significantly reduce draw calls.
    *   **Level of Detail (LOD):** For complex scenes or models, consider implementing `THREE.LOD` to use simpler meshes for objects far from the camera.
    *   **Resource Management:** Double-check that `SceneManager` and `RenderingSystem` diligently dispose of unused geometries, materials, and textures when entities are removed to prevent memory leaks.
3.  **Collision Detection:** `CollisionSystem` is often a performance hotspot.
    *   **Algorithm Choice:** Ensure you're using efficient checks (e.g., sphere-sphere is faster than box-box).
    *   **Spatial Partitioning:** If the number of collidable objects grows large, consider implementing spatial partitioning (like a grid or octree) to quickly eliminate pairs of objects that are too far apart to possibly collide, reducing the number of checks needed each frame.
4.  **System Logic:**
    *   **Minimize Allocations:** In your system `update` loops, avoid allocating new objects (arrays, vectors, etc.) every frame if possible. Reuse existing objects or use primitive types.
    *   **Efficient Queries:** Ensure `world.getEntitiesWith(...)` is performant, especially if called frequently by many systems.

These are general suggestions based on common game development practices and the observed structure. Profiling your game during runtime is the best way to identify specific performance bottlenecks.
