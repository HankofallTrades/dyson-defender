Implementation Plan for Dyson Sphere Defender
This document provides a step-by-step guide for AI developers to implement the base version of Dyson Sphere Defender, a 3D space shooter game. Each step is small, specific, and includes a test to validate correct implementation. The focus is on the core gameplay mechanics as outlined in the game design document, using the recommended tech stack (Three.js, TypeScript, React, Vite, ESLint, Prettier). Additional features like power-ups, multiplayer, or detailed visual/audio styling will be addressed in future iterations. Follow these steps sequentially, completing and testing each before moving to the next.

Step 1: Set Up the Project Structure
Description: Initialize a new project directory using Vite with TypeScript and React as the framework. Install essential dependencies, including Three.js for rendering. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality and consistency.
Test: Run the development server with npm run dev and verify that a basic React application loads in the browser without errors.
Step 2: Implement the Game Loop and Basic Game State
2.1: Define the Game State Interface
Description: Create a TypeScript interface to represent the game state. Include properties such as isGameOver (boolean), score (number), and dysonSphereHealth (number) to track essential game data.
Test: Confirm that the interface compiles successfully with no TypeScript errors.
2.2: Initialize the Game State
Description: Instantiate the game state with default values (e.g., isGameOver: false, score: 0, dysonSphereHealth: 100).
Test: Log the initial game state to the console and ensure all properties display their expected starting values.
2.3: Implement the Game Loop
Description: Create a Game class in TypeScript with a game loop driven by requestAnimationFrame. Include placeholder methods for updating the game state and rendering the scene (to be implemented later).
Test: Add a console log within the game loop and verify that it outputs continuously, indicating the loop is running.
Step 3: Set Up the Three.js Scene
Description: Create a SceneManager class to initialize Three.js components: a scene, a perspective camera, and a WebGL renderer. Append the renderer's DOM element to the page and add basic ambient lighting to the scene.
Test: Add a simple 3D cube to the scene and render it. Check that the cube appears in the browser window.
Step 4: Add the Dyson Sphere
Description: Construct a 3D model for the Dyson Sphere using Three.js's SphereGeometry. Position it at the scene's origin (0, 0, 0) and apply a basic material for visibility (e.g., a solid color).
Test: Render the scene and confirm that the Dyson Sphere is visible at the center of the screen.
Step 5: Implement the Player Spaceship
5.1: Create the 3D Model
Description: Build a simple 3D model for the player's spaceship using Three.js geometries (e.g., a cone or box). Apply a distinct material to differentiate it from the Dyson Sphere.
Test: Add the spaceship to the scene and ensure it appears in the rendered view.
5.2: Position the Ship
Description: Set the spaceship's initial position at a fixed distance from the Dyson Sphere (e.g., along the z-axis) and orient it to face outward or toward the sphere.
Test: Render the scene and verify the spaceship's position and orientation relative to the Dyson Sphere.
5.3: Implement Movement Controls
Description: Add keyboard input handling (e.g., WASD keys) to adjust the spaceship's position. Update the ship's position in the game loop based on these inputs, keeping it within reasonable bounds around the Dyson Sphere.
Test: Press the assigned keys and confirm the spaceship moves accordingly in the scene.
Step 6: Add Player Shooting Mechanics
6.1: Create Laser Objects
Description: Define a 3D model for laser beams using Three.js geometries (e.g., a thin cylinder). Assign a material to make them visually distinct (e.g., bright neon color). Create a function to instantiate lasers.
Test: Manually trigger the function to add a laser to the scene and verify it appears as expected.
6.2: Implement Shooting Logic
Description: Tie a player input (e.g., mouse click) to the laser creation function. When triggered, instantiate a laser at the spaceship's current position with a forward velocity.
Test: Click the mouse and observe lasers spawning from the spaceship's location.
6.3: Update Laser Positions
Description: In the game loop, update each laser's position based on its velocity. Remove lasers from the scene when they travel beyond a predefined distance from their origin.
Test: Fire lasers and confirm they move forward and disappear after reaching the set distance.
Step 7: Implement Enemy Spawning
7.1: Create Enemy Models
Description: Design a 3D model for enemies using Three.js geometries (e.g., a small sphere or cube). Apply a unique material to distinguish them from the player and Dyson Sphere.
Test: Add a single enemy to the scene and ensure it renders correctly.
7.2: Spawn Enemies at Random Positions
Description: Write a function to generate enemies at random positions around the Dyson Sphere (e.g., points on an imaginary sphere surrounding it). Add spawned enemies to the scene and track them in an array within the game state.
Test: Trigger the spawn function and verify that multiple enemies appear at varied locations around the Dyson Sphere.
Step 8: Implement Enemy Movement
Description: In the game loop, update each enemy's position to move toward the Dyson Sphere at a constant speed. Calculate the direction from each enemy's position to the sphere's center and adjust accordingly.
Test: Render the scene and observe enemies steadily approaching the Dyson Sphere from their spawn points.
Step 9: Add Collision Detection
9.1: Detect Laser-Enemy Collisions
Description: In the game loop, check for intersections between each laser and enemy (e.g., using bounding box or distance checks). On collision, remove the laser and either damage or destroy the enemy.
Test: Fire lasers at enemies and confirm that hitting an enemy causes it to disappear or visually indicate damage.
9.2: Detect Enemy-Dyson Sphere Collisions
Description: Check each enemy's distance to the Dyson Sphere in the game loop. If an enemy is close enough (e.g., within a threshold), reduce the Dyson Sphere's health and remove the enemy.
Test: Allow an enemy to reach the Dyson Sphere and verify that the health decreases in the game state.
Step 10: Implement Game Over Condition
Description: In the game loop, monitor the Dyson Sphere's health. If it reaches zero, set isGameOver to true and halt gameplay updates (e.g., stop enemy movement and player controls).
Test: Let enemies reduce the Dyson Sphere's health to zero and confirm that the game stops, with no further updates occurring.
Step 11: Add Basic HUD with React
11.1: Create HUD Components
Description: Develop React components to display game state information, such as the player's score and Dyson Sphere health. Position these components overlaying the Three.js canvas.
Test: Load the game in the browser and ensure the HUD elements are visible on the screen.
11.2: Update HUD Based on Game State
Description: Connect the HUD components to the game state, updating their values whenever the state changes (e.g., score increases or health decreases).
Test: Simulate changes to the game state (e.g., manually adjust health or score) and confirm the HUD reflects these updates in real-time.

Implementation Clarifications
============================

The following clarifications provide additional details to guide the implementation process based on important questions about the game architecture, mechanics, and technical considerations.

1. Game Architecture Details
---------------------------
The Three.js game logic should run independently of React's rendering cycle. Use a custom game loop powered by requestAnimationFrame to manage game state updates and Three.js scene rendering. React should only handle the Heads-Up Display (HUD) updates based on the game state. To enable communication between the two:

- Maintain a shared game state object (e.g., a GameState class or plain object in TypeScript).
- Update this state within the game loop and pass it to React components via props or a state management tool like Redux or Context API.
- Avoid manipulating the DOM or React state directly from the game loop to prevent synchronization issues.

Recommended Pattern: Adopt the Observer Pattern or a Pub-Sub system to notify React of state changes, keeping the game loop and UI loosely coupled.

2. Coordinate System
------------------
Use a coordinate system where 1 unit approximates 1 meter for intuitive scaling:

- Dyson Sphere: Set the radius to 50 units (100 units diameter).
- Player Ship: Size it at approximately 1 unit in length.
- Enemies: Range from 0.5 to 2 units in size, depending on their type.

Reasoning: This scale makes the Dyson Sphere appear massive while keeping the player and enemies visible and manageable, balancing both aesthetics and performance.

3. Wave System
------------
Implement a Wave Manager class to control enemy spawning:

- Structure: Each wave has a set number of enemies that increases with the wave number (e.g., wave 1: 5 enemies, wave 2: 8 enemies). Higher waves feature stronger or faster enemies.
- Triggering: Start a new wave after all enemies in the current wave are defeated, with a short delay (e.g., 5 seconds) before spawning the next wave.
- Display: Show wave details in the HUD (e.g., "Wave 1/5").
- Implementation: Use a state machine or a simple counter to track the current wave and manage enemy spawning.

4. Player Health vs. Dyson Sphere Health
--------------------------------------
For the initial implementation, the game ends only when the Dyson Sphere's health reaches zero. The player ship does not have separate health or lives. This keeps the focus on defending the Dyson Sphere and simplifies early development.

Future Option: Consider adding player health later to enhance difficulty or introduce mechanics like respawning or repair stations.

5. Boosting Mechanism
------------------
Add the boosting mechanism after stabilizing core gameplay mechanics (movement, shooting, enemy spawning, and collision detection). Boosting enhances player mobility and should be treated as a refinement.

Mechanics:
- Include a boost meter that depletes during use and recharges over time.
- Boosting temporarily increases speed (e.g., 2x normal speed for 3 seconds).
- Implementation: Integrate boosting into the player movement system with visual and audio feedback (e.g., particle effects or sound cues).

6. Scoring System
---------------
Points are awarded primarily for destroying enemies:

- Base Scoring: Grant 100 points per enemy destroyed.
- Bonus Points: Award 500 points for completing a wave without the Dyson Sphere taking damage.
- Future Ideas: Add bonuses for accuracy, consecutive kills, or surviving without boosts.

7. Shield Regeneration
--------------------
Implement shield regeneration with a delay mechanism:

- Delay: Shields start regenerating 5 seconds after the Dyson Sphere last takes damage.
- Rate: Shields recover at 1% of max shield per second until fully restored.
- Implementation: Track the last damage timestamp in the game loop and initiate regeneration after the delay, updating the shield value accordingly.

8. Camera Perspective
------------------
There should be options for both first person and third person camera views.

- First Person: Create a view that simulates being inside a retro-futuristic space ship cockpit.
- Third Person: Position the camera behind and slightly above the ship, with smooth rotation to match the ship's orientation.
- Optionally allow zoom or angle adjustments for player preference.

Reasoning: These perspectives offer different gameplay experiences while ensuring a clear view of the game elements.

9. Asset Management
----------------
Placeholder geometries (e.g., spheres, cubes) are sufficient for the initial implementation to prioritize mechanics. However, prepare for future asset integration by:

- Creating an Asset Manager class to load and cache 3D models, textures, and sounds.
- Using consistent naming and organization (e.g., assets/models/, assets/textures/).
- Implementation: Replace placeholders with final assets later, ensuring the Asset Manager supports seamless transitions.

10. HUD Details
-------------
The HUD should include:

- Score: Current player score.
- Dyson Sphere Health: Health percentage.
- Wave Information: Current wave number (and total waves, if applicable).
- Enemy Count: Number of enemies left in the current wave.
- Minimap/Radar: A small overview showing enemy positions relative to the player and Dyson Sphere.
- Implementation: Render these using React components, updated via the shared game state.

11. Game State Serialization
--------------------------
Design the game state to be serializable from the start:

- Use plain objects or JSON-compatible structures (e.g., avoid functions or circular references).
- This enables future features like saving, multiplayer sync, or debugging.
- Implementation: Define the game state with a TypeScript interface using serializable types (e.g., numbers, strings, arrays).

12. Performance Optimization
-------------------------
Address these optimizations early:

- Instancing: Use InstancedMesh for enemies and lasers to minimize draw calls.
- Object Pooling: Reuse objects like lasers and enemies instead of creating/destroying them.
- Particle Limits: Keep particle effects lightweight to maintain performance.
- Profiling: Monitor frame rate with Three.js's stats panel or browser tools and optimize as needed.
- Implementation: Start with these basics and refine as the game scales.
