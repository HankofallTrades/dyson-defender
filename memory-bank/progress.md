# Implementation Progress

## March 21, 2025 - Initial Project Setup

Completed Step 1 of the Implementation Plan: Set up the project structure with Vite, React, TypeScript, and Three.js.

### Tasks Completed:
1. Initialized project with npm and configured package.json
2. Set up TypeScript configuration with tsconfig.json
3. Set up ESLint for code quality
4. Created basic React application structure
5. Implemented initial Game class with Three.js integration
6. Set up simple 3D scene with a cube for testing rendering
7. Implemented game loop using requestAnimationFrame
8. Added proper resource cleanup in the dispose method
9. Set up window resize handling to maintain correct aspect ratio

### Debugging and Fixes:
- Resolved initial blank screen issue by properly configuring the container dimensions
- Added console logging to troubleshoot rendering issues
- Simplified component initialization to ensure proper Three.js setup
- Explicitly set renderer dimensions and styling to fill the container

### Test Results:
- Development server runs without errors
- Basic 3D scene is visible with a rotating green cube
- Resizing the window maintains proper aspect ratio

### Next Steps:
Moving to Step 2: Implementing Game State and Game Loop components:
- Define the Game State Interface
- Initialize the Game State
- Enhance the Game Loop with proper state management

## March 21, 2025 - Game State and Game Loop Implementation

Completed Step 2 of the Implementation Plan: Implemented the Game State interface and enhanced the Game Loop.

### Tasks Completed:
1. Created the GameState interface with properties for game status, player stats, and Dyson Sphere health
2. Implemented GameStateManager class for centralized state management
3. Added serialization/deserialization capabilities to support future multiplayer functionality
4. Enhanced Game class to use the GameStateManager
5. Implemented delta time-based animations for frame-rate independent movement
6. Added game control methods (start, stop, pause, resume, reset)
7. Created a basic HUD in React to display game state information
8. Added UI controls for game interaction (start/pause and reset buttons)

### Improvements:
- Implemented proper state management with TypeScript interfaces
- Added frame-rate independence using delta time calculations
- Created a clean separation between game state and rendering
- Made game state easily serializable for future networked gameplay

### Test Results:
- Game state properly initializes with default values
- Game loop now updates based on elapsed time rather than frame count
- HUD displays game state information (score, health, wave, enemies)
- Game can be paused, resumed, and reset via UI controls

### Next Steps:
Moving to Step 3: Setting up the Three.js Scene with the Dyson Sphere:
- Create a 3D model for the Dyson Sphere using Three.js geometry
- Position it at the center of the scene
- Apply appropriate materials and lighting

## March 24, 2025 - SceneManager Implementation

Completed Step 3 of the Implementation Plan: Created a dedicated SceneManager class to handle the Three.js scene setup and management.

### Tasks Completed:
1. Created a SceneManager class in the rendering directory to encapsulate Three.js functionality
2. Implemented the singleton pattern for efficient scene management and resource sharing
3. Extracted Three.js scene, camera, and renderer setup from Game class to SceneManager
4. Added proper initialization of ambient and directional lighting
5. Included a test cube with animation to verify rendering
6. Implemented proper resource disposal to prevent memory leaks
7. Updated Game class to use SceneManager instead of directly handling Three.js components
8. Set up proper viewport resizing with aspect ratio preservation

### Improvements:
- Better separation of concerns with rendering logic isolated from game logic
- Reduced code duplication through centralized scene management
- Applied singleton pattern for efficient resource sharing
- Established more modular architecture following design patterns specified in project rules
- Created cleaner interfaces between game state, logic, and rendering

### Test Results:
- Verified the game loop runs continuously with proper animation of the test cube
- Confirmed scene renders correctly with appropriate lighting
- Validated proper resource cleanup when the game is disposed
- Ensured responsive resizing maintains correct aspect ratio

### Next Steps:
Moving to Step 4: Adding the Dyson Sphere:
- Create a 3D model for the Dyson Sphere using Three.js's SphereGeometry
- Position it at the scene's origin (0, 0, 0)
- Apply suitable materials for visibility
