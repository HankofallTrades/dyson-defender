Description: Manage game state appropriately. Global state (score, wave count, game status) should ideally reside in `src/core/State.ts` or singleton components. Entity state is managed via components. Design state to be easily serializable (e.g., JSON-friendly) where practical.

Why: Facilitates saving/loading and potential future multiplayer integration by allowing state transfer with minimal refactoring. Clear separation improves state management logic.

File Pattern: Applies primarily to `src/core/State.ts`, `src/core/components.ts`, and systems interacting with global state.
