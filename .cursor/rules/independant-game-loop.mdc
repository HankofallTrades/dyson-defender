Description: Keep the core game loop (`src/core/Game.ts` updating systems) independent of UI updates (`src/ui/*.tsx`). The game loop should run at a consistent rate driven by `requestAnimationFrame`, processing game logic via systems, while React separately handles UI rendering based on the latest state.

Why: Ensures smooth, responsive gameplay by preventing UI rendering bottlenecks from blocking or slowing down core game logic execution.

File Pattern: Applies to `src/core/Game.ts` and `src/ui/*.tsx`.
