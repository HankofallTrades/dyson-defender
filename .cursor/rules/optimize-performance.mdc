Description: Optimize code for performance:
In game logic, minimize operations that trigger garbage collection (e.g., avoid frequent object allocations).
In rendering, use efficient Three.js practices like instancing for repeated objects and proper disposal of unused objects (e.g., mesh.dispose()).

Why: Performance is critical in games, especially with 3D rendering, to ensure smooth gameplay and efficient resource use.

File Pattern: Applies to src/core/Mechanics.ts and src/rendering/Scene.ts.
