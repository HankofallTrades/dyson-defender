Description: Utilize TypeScript's static typing features robustly throughout the codebase. Define and use interfaces or types for all significant data structures, function signatures, and variables.

Why: Improves code clarity, enhances maintainability, and catches potential errors during development, which is crucial for complex game logic.

File Pattern: Applies project-wide (`src/**/*.ts`, `src/**/*.tsx`).

Guidelines:
    1. Define component interfaces in `src/core/components.ts`.
    2. Place shared, non-component types/interfaces in `src/types/`.
    3. Use explicit types for function parameters and return values.
    4. Avoid using `any` unless absolutely necessary and justified.
