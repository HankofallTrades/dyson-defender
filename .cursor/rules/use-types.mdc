Description: Define interfaces or types for all game objects, states, events, and significant data structures using TypeScript. Ensure every variable and function has an explicit type where applicable.

Why: Type safety catches errors early, improves code readability, and makes the game logic more robustâ€”crucial for complex systems like ours.

File Pattern: Applies to src/core/*.ts.
