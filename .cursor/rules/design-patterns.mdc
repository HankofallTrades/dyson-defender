Description: Implement game development design patterns, such as the Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern, to manage game entities and their behaviors efficiently.

Why: Patterns like ECS provide flexibility and scalability, making it easier to add new features or modify existing ones without breaking the system.

File Pattern: Applies to src/core/Mechanics.ts and entity-related files.
